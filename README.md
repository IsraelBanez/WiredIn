## Motivation, Overview, and Intended Impact
Our original goal for this project was to make cyber-related information more attainable, especially to those who aren’t familiar with this area. To accomplish this, we designed and created a website to portray the topics we generated and hopefully give access to anyone who was willing.

## Technologies Used (with Documentation)
 - React / React Bootstrap
 - Node
 - Firebase Realtime Database

React and (React) Bootstrap were the main resources used for the design and functionality of the frontend. Initially, we were utilizing their built-in Bootstrap components, but we ended up using react for its libraries instead. Our backend was created using a combination of Node.js and Firebase’s Realtime Database. Node.js allowed for a simple command to start up our project when we wanted to test and showcase it, while Firebase allowed for us to store user information when creating an account and/or signing in.
