            Malware: Tips and Tricks for Prevention
            <br></br>
        </p>

        <p className='text-container'>
          Malware, or malicious software, is a type of program that is designed to damage or disrupt computer systems. Malware can take many different forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware. One of the most important things you can do to protect your computer and data from malware is to be aware of the symptoms. In this section, we'll discuss some common symptoms of malware that you should watch out for.
        </p>

        <p className='text-container'>
          <b>Unauthorized email:</b>
          <br></br>
          It’s possible for an email to contain malware (especially ones in the spam folder). These emails may appear harmless, and can even be from someone you know. There is always a chance for a friend’s or family’s device to be compromised and allow for the original third party to send their malware to other listed contacts. However, emails containing hidden malware can cause harm to your computer or steal your personal information, meaning that emails should always be approached with caution.
          <br></br>
          Some possible inclusions of malware inside of an email include:
          <br></br><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Attachments: File attachments can be used to hide malware, such as in a document or image. When one of these attachments is opened, the malware can infect your computer.</li>
            <li>Links: Emails can also contain links that direct you to malicious websites. Clicking on these links can lead to the download and installation of malware on your system. This option can seem easy to spot, but oftentimes a malicious link looks extremely similar to the legitimate one, or is linked to a word in the email. If someone is caught off guard or not paying attention, it's extremely easy to click on the link and infect a device.</li>
            <li>Phishing: Some emails may attempt to trick recipients into providing your sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information. These emails often appear credible but are specifically designed to steal information for malicious purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          To avoid this problem: To protect yourself from malware in emails, it's important to be cautious. Refrain from opening files and attachments or clicking on links from unknown sources. Be aware that asking for personal information over email is skeptical and the source of the email should probably be checked for legitimacy. Additionally, keeping your antivirus software up to date and running regular system scans can help detect and also remove malware from your computer.
        </p>

          <b>System Usage:</b>
          <br></br>
          After malware has been downloaded and/or run on a system, one may experience some suspicious behavior. Here are a few signs to look out for:
          <br></br><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Poor performance: A computer may start running slower than usual. Applications may take longer to open, edit, and close. A system may frequently become unresponsive at times.</li>
            <li>Ads: If pop-up ads begin appearing, even when you're not browsing the internet, it’s a pretty solid sign that malware is present. In terms of severity, pop-ups are a relatively glaring example because it means the malicious party is not concerned with being noticed by the user. They want the user to see the image(s) and struggle with removing the problematic software.</li>
            <li>System crashes: A computer may crash or freeze more frequently, requiring more restarts than usual. This symptom doesn’t always mean malware, so it is important to note other possibilities first before coming to this conclusion.</li>
            <li>Error messages: You may start seeing unusual error messages that you haven't encountered before. Similar to crashing, technical devices are prone to a variety of issues, so be sure to check every avenue before landing on malware.</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access: In some cases, malware can provide remote access to hackers, allowing them to control your computer, email, or personal information without your knowledge. If you see any unusual activity like this, it's important to investigate it further to make sure that your information is safe.</li>
          </ul>
        </p> 

        <p className='text-container'>
          <b>Network activity:</b>
          <br></br>
          Malware can also cause unusual network activity. This means that your computer might be communicating with other computers or networks without your knowledge. Some ways it can manipulate network activity include:
          <br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Unusual data transfers: Malware can instantiate connections to the internet or other computers on the network in unauthorized ways. It may send out sensitive or personal information from your computer to a remote attacker without any warning or indication.</li>
            <li>Noticeable bandwidth consumption: Some malware, especially botnets (waves of infected devices), can use your network connection to perform malicious attacks like sending spam emails. These activities take up some of the total available bandwidth and can slow down internet connections.</li>
            <li>Network scans: Malware often actively scans local networks or the internet for vulnerable computers or devices to use as their victim. This network scanning can result in increased network traffic and potentially damage or infect other systems.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p className='text-container'>
          <b>Memory misuse:</b>
          <br></br>
          Another sign of malware is when your computer's memory is being used in unusual ways. If you notice that your computer is running slower than usual, or if you see warning messages about low memory, it's possible that malware is causing the problem. Malware-related memory problems can include:
          <br></br><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Memory leaks: Some malware is specifically tailored to exploit vulnerabilities in certain softwares, which can cause memory leaks. This means that the malware continuously utilizes memory without releasing it to other applications. A system begins to develop a lack of usable memory, leading to reduced performance and possibly even crashes.</li>
            <li>Resource Shortage: Malware can possess a significant amount of system resources, such as computing power. This can make a computer sluggish and unresponsive, because the malware is always competing to take more resources away from legitimate programs.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p className='text-container'>
          If you suspect that you have downloaded malware, it's best to immediately seek assistance from a knowledgeable person or a professional to investigate and resolve the issue. It is generally advised to never interact with the malicious party if they ever reach out for communication. A situation involving malware has no guarantee of access or safety recovery, usually encourages the attackers to target you again, and further supports their criminal actions.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Some things you can do to protect your computer from malware include:
          <br></br><br></br>
          <ol>
            <li>Installing anti-virus and anti-malware software</li>
            <li>Keeping your operating system and other software up-to-date</li>
            <li>Being cautious when opening emails or attachments from unknown sources</li>
            <li>Avoiding clicking on suspicious links or pop-ups</li>
          </ol>
          <br></br>
          Remember, being aware of the symptoms of malware is the first step in protecting your computer and data from harm.
