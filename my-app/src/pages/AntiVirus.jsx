            Pros of Anti-Virus Software:
            <br></br><br></br>
            Protection against Malware: One of the most significant advantages of using antivirus software is that it provides protection against malware. Antivirus software can detect and remove malware from your computer, preventing it from causing any harm.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Peace of Mind: Knowing that your computer is protected by antivirus software can give you peace of mind. You can rest easy, knowing that your personal information is safe and secure.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Automatic Updates: Most antivirus software programs are designed to automatically update themselves. This means that you don't have to worry about manually updating the software to ensure that it's up-to-date and able to detect the latest threats.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Scanning Capabilities: Antivirus software can scan your computer system for malware, even if it's hidden deep within your system. This allows you to detect and remove malware that you may not have known existed.

            Cons of Anti-Virus Software:
            <br></br><br></br>
            System Performance: Antivirus software can sometimes slow down your computer's performance. This is because the software needs to run in the background, continuously scanning your system for malware. This can be particularly noticeable on older computers or those with less powerful processors.
            <br></br><br></br>
            False Positives: Antivirus software can sometimes mistakenly flag legitimate programs as malware. This is known as a false positive. While it's rare, false positives can occur, and they can cause a lot of headaches if you're trying to use a legitimate program that's been flagged as malware.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Cost: While there are many free antivirus software programs available, some of the more robust ones can come at a cost. This can be a disadvantage for individuals or businesses on a tight budget.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Not 100% Foolproof: Even with antivirus software, your computer is not completely immune to malware. There is always a chance that new, undetected malware can slip through the cracks and infect your system.
